        <p>Hi! I am Chi, a web developer and software developer with a keen eye for design. I am currently based in the beautiful city of Seattle, WA. I am passionate about emerging and immersive technology and using it to solve the inefficiencies in our world. Before discovering the joy of coding, I accumulated diverse experience working in a wide range of industries including Investment Banking, Financial Tech, and Consumer Goods. I enjoy dissecting problems from different angles and wrestling with questions to find optimal solutions. </p>
        <p>When I am not coding, you might find me hiking, skiing, learning to dance salsa, or reading.</p>
